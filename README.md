# Web-Design-Challenge

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

A landing page containing:

An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page, with a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.


Four visualization pages, each with:

A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


A "Comparisons" page that:

Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

The grid is two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.




A "Data" page that:

Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The data comes from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML.
